I sits down at my desk, opens my little indigo notebook, and writes it down word for word, in a circle, just the same as it’s been going round and round my head:<br><br><i>Drawing a line between two things that don’t exist yet. <br><br></i>“Well, there we go,” I says, “all done! Now I’ll put some coffee on, then start in the garden.”<br><br><i>Not so fast,</i> she says, just like always: <i>first</i><i> you have to </i><i>sit here and </i><i>think about it</i>.<br><br>“Ah,” I sighs, “fine!”<br><br>Well, first thing it brings to mind are some doodles she was having me do a few days back: lines and circles and spirals with different bits of 'em labelled: start, middle, end.<br><br>“So it’s start and end I guess? The two things that don’t exist yet?”<br><br><i>Well, do they, or </i><i>do</i><i>n’t</i><i> they</i><i>?</i> She says.<br><br>Here we go again!<br><br>So, “Yes,” I says: “the start must have existed from the moment the pen touched the page, and the end from the moment it lifted up again.”<br><br><i>That seems a little short-sighted,</i> she says. Again, just like always.<br><br>“Alright, no then!”<br><br>Because of course: Where did the pen come from? When did this poem really begin? Was it with the silent utterance of that very first word this morning: Drawing? But then where did that word come from? When was it first thought or spoken? First time old limpy dragged his leg across the drawing room floor? First time the curtains ever got drawn? And did it go and change again just then? Same old news o’ the never-ending!<br><br>“I suppose it’s going to be yes and no again then, is it dear? But if I says yes, and you says no, well: we can’t both be right, can we?”<br><br><i>Wrong,</i> she says,<i> we can both be right if either one, or both of us, is wrong! Only if we are both rational beings can we never agree to disagree!<br><br></i>Ah, the contrary creature is making fun of me! Referencing recent developments in my stulted attempts to edificate mice elves.<br><br><i>So I will make myself the irrational one. </i><i>M</i><i>e, here, on the page – </i><i>p</i><i>oetry, say</i><i>.</i><i> </i><i>A</i><i>nd you, there, off the page, out in the always-already real world: you can be rational man, you can question me,</i><i> </i><i>then</i><i> dismiss my answers as unsatisfactory, again </i><i>and</i><i> again, until you hear something </i><i>a bit more like </i><i>w</i><i>hat</i><i> </i><i>you yourself might</i><i> say, something </i><i>nice and</i><i> </i><i>sensible, </i><i>easy to agree with. </i><i>Like, </i><i>for instance:</i><i> </i><i>t</i><i>he start </i><i>must</i><i> exist already</i><i>, </i><i>else</i><i> I wouldn’t be able to begin drawing my line, and the end </i><i>must</i><i> not exist </i><i>yet</i><i>, </i><i>else</i><i> </i><i>w</i><i>e</i><i> wouldn’t be here t</i><i>hink</i><i>ing</i><i> about it.<br><br></i>“Well, then I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt, dearest.” <br><br>“So shall we say that – whatever these two things might eventually turn out to be, whether they are you and me, or prose and poetry – the essence of your message most likely concerns my being requested to meditate upon the sense in which they do not exist, or at least: not yet – correct? But then what do you mean by that, exactly? What do you mean by existence?”<br><br><i>Th</i><i>e act of</i><i> stand</i><i>ing</i><i> out, </i>she says.<br><br>Aha! A straightforward answer for once!<br><br>“Then do go on.”<br><br><i>Well,</i><i> w</i><i>hat </i><i>might </i><i>stand out when the line is drawn? </i><i>And m</i><i>ust something</i><i> </i><i>necessarily </i><i>recede in order that it </i><i>may</i><i>? </i><i>Should we suppose this ever-recessive thing to be </i><i>our</i><i> ground – </i><i>t</i><i>he eart</i><i>h</i><i> itself perhaps – </i><i>now becom</i><i>ing</i><i> </i><i>background? </i><i>Negative space?</i><i> But is it not that in making our mark we have drawn attention to this</i><i>,</i><i> too?</i><i> </i><i> <br><br></i><i>Would you like to hear something funny, Old John?<br>D</i><i>id you ever hear the </i><i>one about</i><i> genius scarecrow?<br></i><i>O</i><i>ut standing in his field he was! <br>How existential is that</i><i>?</i><i>!<br><br></i>Now, why is she on about the bloody scarecrow again? I did my best with it, to atone, to make amends, to find a better way to get along with my so-called feathered friends.<br><br>“Why are you on about the scarecrow again, missus?”<br><br><i>The scarecrow is the line we drew, are drawing. </i><i>This poem is </i><i>the</i><i> scarecrow,</i><i> okay? <br><br></i><i>The </i><i>spaces between words</i><i> are </i><i>the </i><i>holes in the old clothes where </i><i>the</i><i> h</i><i>ay</i><i> pokes out. A robin nests in his top pocket, </i><i>like a punctuation mark</i><i>. Woodlice are </i><i>his</i><i> itches, b</i><i>ut also</i><i> how he scratches them, </i><i>like stanzas or paragraphs</i><i>. </i><i>H</i><i>e wears a Witch’s Hat</i><i>.<br><br></i><i>This hat</i><i> </i><i>signifies the personality of his creator. It is a very complex sign – </i><i>style could</i><i> be its name –</i><i> but it was a very simple act, giving him that hat, do you remember? A natural one. A moment of inspiration which planted a smile on </i><i>your</i><i> </i><i>gloomy </i><i>old farmer’s face, on what would otherwise have been a day without a glimmer of sunshine…<br><br></i>Well then, she’s at it again, speaking my own life back like someone else’s story, digging for the moral of it, right? Which means I’ll have done something wrong, but then she’ll make it worth the pain, because in the end it won’t be right or wrong, it’ll turn out good, it’ll be given meaning. That’s what she is I reckon, that’s how she always knows it’s there: meaning. Only it’s never simples, it always leaves me wondering. <i>Which is j</i><i>ust precisely</i><i> what it is,</i> she whispers now, meaning meaning is wonder, more or less, and leaving me none the wiser.<br><br><i>A</i><i>nd so a</i><i>ll th</i><i>os</i><i>e clothes the scarecrow wears – all that makes </i><i>up </i><i>the scarecrow’s skin, all that gives him shape, </i><i>all </i><i>that defines him – </i><i>all this </i><i>once belonged to Farmer </i><i>John</i><i>. Should we then suppose, that </i><i>in </i><i>shedding </i><i>his</i><i> skin</i><i>, O</i><i>ld John reveals his nature as something somehow snake-like</i><i>? </i><i>Well, is he </i><i>not, after all, a </i><i>continu</i><i>al </i><i>um </i><i>of spacetimeaning</i><i>? </i><i>H</i><i>is </i><i>earthy </i><i>e</i><i>xistence</i><i> one long and sinuous slither? </i><i>S</i><i>leep</i><i> </i><i>but</i><i> black diamonds </i><i>up</i><i>on his back?<br><br></i><i>Think back: all those disparate events that came together to make the tip of his time-tail, </i><i>that will return to chaos from the crown of his old scaly head. </i><i>B</i><i>ut</i><i> </i><i>wasn’t this snake once an egg? Was there not a time before head became head, and tail began to trail? </i><i>And s</i><i>o</i><i> which part of the snake r</i><i>emains</i><i> </i><i>the egg? </i><i>It </i><i>would </i><i>seem </i><i>to me</i><i> less like </i><i>the tip of the tail than like </i><i>a skin that c</i><i>an't</i><i> b</i><i>e</i><i> shed! But where</i><i> </i><i>w</i><i>ould that</i><i> leave the end? S</i><i>till got some hatching to do, Our John?</i><i> <br><br></i><i>A</i><i>nd </i><i>then</i><i> what is</i><i> the scarecrow to </i><i>th</i><i>e</i><i> </i><i>snake</i><i>? </i><i>Does that forked tongue </i><i>be</i><i>speak its haunting by the eternal tree? S</i><i>ome</i><i> impossible path</i><i> </i><i>of the </i><i>O</i><i>ne that all beings must be on?</i><i> </i><i>T</i><i>o whom does existence </i><i>belong? F</i><i>or whom d</i><i>oes </i><i>F</i><i>armer John long? Why does he carry on? Why did he</i><i> </i><i>n</i><i>ot</i><i> </i><i>become the scarecrow </i><i>himself</i><i>, hang</i><i> more than </i><i>just </i><i>his clothes on that old cross? D</i><i>oes p</i><i>oetry</i><i> now</i><i> reveal its</i><i> </i><i>desire</i><i> to </i><i>see him</i><i> crucifi</i><i>ed</i><i>? I</i><i>f </i><i>this</i><i> </i><i>very </i><i>line </i><i>is</i><i> drawn from life, </i><i>c</i><i>ould</i><i> that </i><i>be</i><i> why the </i><i>old</i><i> farmer’s face is </i><i>gett</i><i>ing</i><i> gaunt? </i><i>I</i><i>s thi</i><i>s</i><i> poem draining</i><i> him? A</i><i>m I a</i><i> parasite?<br><br></i>Ah, I see. She gets like this sometimes...<br><br>“No,” says I, “don’t worry yourself, my dear poetry, you do remain a most willing expenditure of energy. In fact you cannot know how much it is that you return to me. Unless perhaps you contemplate your own beginnings and ends, to find yourself awake in my life again, struggling to rise above subsistence, nourishing my ever-active resistance to becoming a mere blood-pump who must spend all day sat inside a giant robot, nothing more to do with his vital spark than flick that single switch, both start and end, beginning and stop, on and off, repetitive and ceaseless.”<br><br>“So I insist on continuing to exist, and you are my path in the garden, to the garden: the end of the farm, and perhaps the origin of it. My own personal Eden. The Transfiguration of Old Farmer John you are! You make me the thought gardener: a ray of sun all the more delicious for the slate grey sky!”<br><br>“Indeed, it <em>was</em> in sadness, in loss, that I erected my scarecrow poem. But it was not in <em>my</em> image, but in <em>hers</em>, that I made him. Although she<i> is</i> my image, if you ask me. Perhaps what's most important here is that we can be seen to share an idea, like that of kind, or friend, which would make our mutual inspiration that much more evident. My scarecrow never was just a bag of old clothes, you see: his flesh is the fields, the trees are his bones.”<br><br>And so, “Welcome to Friend Ship Earth” I says, “an always astonishing partnership of infinitely definite terms: language &amp; person, poetry &amp; garden, &amp; so on &amp; sow on...”<br><br>“And scarecrow &amp; crow, I suppose! You used to be a shotgun, you know? That was my big idea: double-barreled eyes raining lead into the sky to bring down the clouds of blackness that ever threaten our lives…”<br><br><i>And t</i><i>hen</i><i> </i><i>you </i><i>would</i><i> feel her eyes </i><i>up</i><i>on your back, right</i><i> John?</i><i> </i><i>Even t</i><i>hough she was u</i><i>p by</i><i> the house, far from the fields. And when you pull</i><i>ed</i><i> the trigger </i><i>you </i><i>would</i><i> shoot outside yourself, </i><i>yet</i><i> what </i><i>got </i><i>shot out w</i><i>as</i><i> too fast to follow. </i><i>S</i><i>o</i><i> </i><i>would</i><i> you come back to yourself with the echo, like a giant angry bat </i><i>you were</i><i>, bouncing back off the walls of your world, until one day you got a</i><i> quick</i><i> and </i><i>t</i><i>horough</i><i> flash of it:<br><br></i><i>The line was drawn between your I and the bird, twined through th</i><i>ose</i><i> double-barrel</i><i>ed eyes</i><i> and s</i><i>pun out </i><i>into the woven</i><i> </i><i>sky. And there was no recoil but</i><i> </i><i>she who jumped in the garden, </i><i>she </i><i>whose shoulders clenched as she cursed you. </i><i>And there was n</i><i>o recoil but the sudden flight of the hare, the starlings leaping up like dust from a beaten rug, </i><i>the staggered plops of pond and frog, </i><i>the hundred thousand eyes of primrose, th</i><i>e</i><i> strain </i><i>in</i><i> the little wren’s throat.<br><br></i>“I don’t blame her for leaving me, poetry,” I sobs.<br><br>(And then that thought, without pause, makes itself a joke of sorts – I don’t blame her for leaving me poetry – as if the Goddess herself were my dearly departed, and all I had left were these words to bemuse myself with.)<br><br>But I did blame her for it, at the time. It took me a long time to accept that I had scared her off, that I had told her to go, that I had wanted it, too. I have a lot of respect now, for the strength it must have taken her to go, to break all the ties that bound her to her life here. But then she always did have one eye on the lights that twinkle in the night.<br><br>I've often wished I could have followed her there. I sometimes wonder if that’s what these lines are shooting for: the old farmer’s thoughts tracing themselves before him like the tracks of a unicorn. Because that’s what she was really. That’s what she <i>is,</i> I mean. My delicate white horse-goat shining in the springtime wood, looking over her shoulder at me, standing amongst the hazel trunks above the carpet of bluebells, her dignified animal thought-light twirling gentle but unwavering out her river-run spine.<br><br>Let these words find that sparkle again! Let them do what my hands never could and stroke the full extent of that impossible length! Let them call her back to me, in the ruptured silence that lays like bee-buzz and birdsong upon the ever-altering altar of this thought gardener’s active prayer...<br><br>And so I find myself standing before the scarecrow now, naked except for her black and pointed hat: I have taken that back, for it was never mine to give. “Well then, they tell me you were made in our image, old friend? But now we’ve gone and changed again! And all you’ve done is age, it seems to me, worn away here and there like the banks of the wee stream.”<br><br>“But perhaps I’m being mean, or stingy? Somehow limiting you unnecessarily? I can’t quite be sure. In fact, I seem to have forgotten exactly what a limit is? For the life of me I can't retrieve the sense of it!”<br><br>“I can remember once saying: these limits are what I am, and it seeming like a revelation somehow. Drawing a line between two things that don’t yet exist, I guess? But why must it always be two things? And why did I look to what I seemed not to be to delimit me? Those strange feline eyes looking out from the butterfly’s wings, the fairies surfing on the falling leaves, fucking in the open flowers..?”<br><br><i>When </i><i>first </i><i>you f</i><i>elt your </i><i>fist </i><i>r</i><i>elax</i><i> in </i><i>response to the </i><i>lightly clenched smile </i><i>upon the </i><i>thirsty </i><i>horse’s</i><i> </i><i>face</i><i>, what w</i><i>as it that made it possible</i><i> but the endless, wordless, rhyming of all ideas? <br><br></i><i>A</i><i>ll ideas based on life.<br><br></i>“Then it was death that I meant to shoot from the sky? Yet, if it was, it sure wasn’t mine! Could it be that crow scared me, because it couldn’t scare I – I couldn’t share, I – I am shared now, shared so far around...”<br><br><i>the stream becomes cloud, for a while the cloud rains,</i><i> </i><i>then the sun comes out again, makes egg yolk of itself in every </i><i>sparkling </i><i>drop </i><i>that h</i><i>angs upon</i><i> her</i><i> webby cloth<br><br></i>“...I dress myself in your silken armour, love, run my face straight into that impossible freshness of yours, smiling baby-breath warmth of innocence experienced again, for whatever else existence is it is always a meeting, a reunion of sorts: back to back and face to face, no matter how far apart we are in space.”<br><br>I got the impression that you wandered through the house again, as I was writing just then. I can still feel your feet shuffling through my brain, the skulled sensation of your opening and closing cupboard doors. I stretch my jaw to loosen my earholes, then blow you a kiss, so absent-minded it seems like an echo – only it cannot have been an echo, because just now I realize how very deeply that I meant it.<br><br>O what a beautiful word that is! Kiss! It seems to peck up my lips, make them food in the belly of that other black bird of poetry: the real black bird: blackbird blackbird.<br><br>Kiss kiss kiss – it sounds like what it is! How great is this?! How tautologically unrepresentative! A smack of the lips! A click of the tongue! First human word! Nameless name of reverberant verb still echoing!<br><br>Not mama! Not papa! Not cuckoo! Not caca! <br>But Look! Here! Hey! Check this out!<br>Something’s happening! Prick up yer ears mush!<br><br>Old Scarecrow John the Unicorn Farmer has come!<br>Come to demonstrate the limits of Thought Gardening<br>through a short course in Scarecrow Erection,<br>dressed in Nothing but the pink satin<br>Jungian Slip he was born with! <br>Sensing wife is the safest way to say why<br>his body might now draw the realest of lines<br>around the dancing stars of his eyes:<br>Crow’s Feet, Laughter Lines, Pleasure Paths:<br>little pots of Rainbow Gold<br>found far Beyond The End of Thee<br>Psychotic Spectrum, Supposedly!<br><br>For who needs a clearer picture of freedom than the eversion of their very own limits?! Free will never did mean you could just up and fly, right? It always meant something more like: gliders are better than jumbo jets, but your most angelic fantasies better yet – and the devil’s an angel too don’t forget!<br><br>So lettuce be a-wary of thinking something needs defending when it does not. Like imagination! Distinguish it from fancy at your peril, Beryl! Perfectly pert Ancient Greek bottoms were not sculpted into being to be sat on! This neat and tidy techno-shiny run-a-mockery of civilization always was just begging to be shat on! Culture is a wilder idea than nature ever was! Yet verily was it spake that to blaspheme the earth is now the most dreadful of sins, so long as you can grasp that the only mark we ever miss must be the heart’s!<br><br>And so lettuce be a-wary too, of thinking something doesn’t need defending when it does. Like every bodies’ Lover Earth against all who would make it but dirt! Like you yourself against all the wrong ways to think yourself great! There is nothing smaller than an individual, sun, and yet nothing more significant than that which can purr-sun-all become!

He was wearing her nightgown, a silky shimmering rainbow slip of a thing, and had her black, pointed, wide-brimmed hat upon his head.

Stop! End! Enough! OK!” – still it kept on going round – “Thank you! Grassy arse? Up! Down! Smile? Shoot? Oh fuck it–” he said, and clicked off the switch with his thumb.<br><br>*<br><br>(((Peas &amp; Lovage from me &amp; Old John, if you managed to read all that! Well done!
