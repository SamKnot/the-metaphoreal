In other words: I made this episode around Halloween/Samhain, so it has a bit of a late autumn vibe.<br><br>Warring spiders, the odd giggle, birdsong, churchbells, unicorns, magic mushrooms - what's not to like? Apart from me, of course.</p>\n<p>Metaphorce be with you, all the same 🙂 </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://samknot.com/media/posts/1/metaphoreal-s01e01-scan-360kb.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://samknot.com/media/posts/1/responsive/metaphoreal-s01e01-scan-360kb-xs.jpg 300w ,https://samknot.com/media/posts/1/responsive/metaphoreal-s01e01-scan-360kb-sm.jpg 480w ,https://samknot.com/media/posts/1/responsive/metaphoreal-s01e01-scan-360kb-md.jpg 768w ,https://samknot.com/media/posts/1/responsive/metaphoreal-s01e01-scan-360kb-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://samknot.com/media/posts/1/responsive/metaphoreal-s01e01-scan-360kb-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://samknot.com/media/posts/1/responsive/metaphoreal-s01e01-scan-360kb-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"Cover image for Sam Knot's The Metaphoreal s01e01\" width=\"530\" height=\"750\"></figure>",
